While working at Panther Labs, I rewrote and reorganized every page of the docs set. To enhance clarity and consistency, I developed and implemented templates across the documentation set to ensure we included explanation, how-to, and reference content.

 - Explanation docs: See the [Panther Developer Workflows](https://docs.panther.com/panther-developer-workflows/overview) section of the docs.
 - How-to docs: See the [Panther S3 Source](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/aws/s3) docs.
 - Reference docs: See the [Panther Data Lakes](https://docs.panther.com/search/backend) docs.
 - KB article: [What do I do if Iâ€™m locked out of Instagram, Facebook, or another third-party Duo Mobile account?](https://help.duo.com/s/article/5640)
 - Long-form guide: [Guide to Duo Restore for Duo Mobile account recovery](https://help.duo.com/s/article/duo-restore)
 - Blogs: Click the [Blogs](/posts) link at the top of this site!
