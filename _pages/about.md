I am focused on all things customer enablement. My experience includes technical product documentation, implementing a knowledge base from the ground up, running a Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) program within global support teams, developing tech writing talent in junior technical writers and support team members, advocating for customer needs, acting quickly on customer feedback, upselling product features to support a customer's deployment, troubleshooting technical issues directly with customers, and walking customers through integrations and product implementations.
