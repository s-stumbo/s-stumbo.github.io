### Professional
I am focused on all things customer enablement!  

My background as a Technical Support Engineer has given me a deep understanding of the customer, resulting in a strategic, customer-focused approach to everything I do. In my 10+ years at tech startups, I have always had an active role in contributing to external content and advocating for customers. In my most recent role, I was the Manager of Documentation and Knowledge at Panther Labs, a cybersecurity detection and response platform.  

I believe that technical writing is not just about the content itself, but itâ€™s also about advocating for the customer experience, structuring the support role around knowledge-sharing, and collaborating closely with Product & Engineering teams to influence product development. Knowledge plays a key role in the success of support teams and customers!


My experience includes technical product documentation, implementing a knowledge base from the ground up, running a Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) program within global support teams, developing tech writing talent in junior technical writers and support team members, advocating for customer needs, acting quickly on customer feedback, upselling product features to support a customer's deployment, troubleshooting technical issues directly with customers, developing and conducting live training to groups ranging in size from 10 to 100, and walking customers through integrations and product implementations. 

For more specifics on my skillset and experience, see my [Resume](/resume) page.

### Personal
I love to learn! I'm currently taking a course about understanding and treating childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Next on my list of things I plan to learn (yes I have a list) is how I can become a public school special education advocate in my spare time. 

I have picked up a lot of hobbies and interests over the years: guitar, singing, baking and decorating cake pops and cookies, sewing, vinyl crafting, painting, true crime, and reading.
