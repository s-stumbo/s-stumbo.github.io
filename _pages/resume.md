# Work Experience
## Manager, Knowledge & Documentation - Panther Labs
### November 2021 - April 2024
Panther Labs is a cloud-native, code-driven detection and response platform. 
- Established content operations from the ground up: Revitalized the existing documentation, reworked the taxonomy based on customer journey, formatted and rewrote content for ease of consumption, and applied templates across pages for consistency.
- Developed training content, developed a process for contribution and governance of content, refined the technical writing style guide to promote quality writing across the company, and developed a docs publication process for weekly and bi-weekly product releases.
- Ran the documentation side of releases: Wrote initial drafts, collaborated with engineers and product managers on content, and published it before the deadline every week.
- Wrote, edited, and published company release notes via WordPress.
- Developed the company’s first public Knowledge Base, and introduced and ran a Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) program within the support team. KCS helps foster a culture of collaboration, and together with the support team we created 500+ help articles in the first year of having a KB!
- Implemented a KB article scorecard process to train, provide feedback, and improve the quality of KB article contributions from our support engineers. The overall team article quality score started at a baseline of 77% and went to 90% a year into the program.
- Tracked docs and KB metrics to share with company leadership and provide insight into customer struggles.
- Contributed to weekly support management meetings, support case reviews, and support training documentation.
- Performed content audits to ensure accurate and up-to-date information in the documentation and knowledge base, performed docs site accessibility audit to comply with WCAG 2.1 standards.

  
**Writing Samples**
 
While working at Panther, I rewrote and reorganized every page of the docs set. For a specific example, see the [Panther Developer Workflows section](https://docs.panther.com/panther-developer-workflows/overview) of the docs. 

## Technical Writer III - Duo Security (now a part of Cisco) 
### June 2016 - November 2021
- Wrote, edited, verified, and published KB articles for internal and external consumption.
- Developed the KB Publisher program: I mentored support engineers to improve their technical writing skills and helped them work toward earning publishing rights in the KB.
- Managed and developed talent in a junior technical writer.
- Contributed to, edited, and reviewed training/enablement content for Duo’s Learning Management System (LMS).
- Planned and deployed Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) v6 strategies.
- Interviewed job candidates and scored writing tests in the Customer Success department.
- In my first role at Duo (June 2016-April 2018), I was a Technical Support Engineer. I assisted customers with technical troubleshooting via phone, chat, and email, and contributed technical content to the KB. The areas of troubleshooting included computer networking, DNS, RADIUS, LDAP, SSO, authentication proxy, Active Directory, and various technical software integrations.
