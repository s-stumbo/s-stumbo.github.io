> "Mommy, what does this do?"
  
A question I’ve heard 1,000 times from my kids regarding 1,000 different things. This time, though, I realized I didn’t have my usual in-depth soliloquy prepared to bore my son to sleep while answering his basic question. When he asked, he was pointing out the pickup on his Fender Telecaster electric guitar.

"It helps the guitar make sounds," I told him. 

If you know any elementary school aged children, then you know his next question. 

> "How?" 

The alarms were going off in my Technical Writer Brain, as I felt the urgent need to research, learn everything I could, then convey the information clearly and concisely to a child. 

Welcome to my quest to explain electric guitars to my 2nd grader! While I am simplifying the language for a child, this information should be helpful to readers of any age who wish to understand the basics of an electric guitar.

In order to understand how a guitar's pickups work, it's important to also understand the other parts of an electric guitar and what each of them does. Let's discuss strings, pickups and signal processing, and amplification.

## Strings

When you run a guitar pick or your fingers across the strings of an electric guitar, it converts the vibrations of its strings into electrical signals that can be amplified and converted into sound. 

Electric guitar strings are usually made from steel, nickel, brass, or bronze. The material and construction of a string have an impact on the sound, and guitarists have a wide range to choose from depending on the sound they want to make. 

When it comes to factory strings that come installed on a new guitar, you can think of these like the basic tires that come with your car. They will get the job done for now, but you're going to want to replace them at some point.

> :bulb: **My Go-To**: I usually opt for Ernie Ball Slinky Cobalt strings. Ernie Ball claims that these strings are engineered to maximize output and clarity, as the cobalt steel wrap on the strings provides a stronger magnetic relationship between the strings and pickups. In simpler terms, this is meant to result in more sustain and a clearer sound. In the past I've experimented with different styles and string gauges in the Ernie Ball line, and I've been satisfied with all.

## Pickups
The pickups are magnets wrapped in wire coils that are mounted on the body of the guitar. When the strings vibrate, the magnetic field around the strings changes, inducing a current in the wire coils of the pickups. 

### Signal Processing

The current generated by the pickups is a weak electrical signal that needs to be amplified. The signal is sent through the guitar's electronics, including volume and tone controls, and then to an amplifier.

> :bulb: **My Go-To**:  Look at me, I couldn't explain in-depth what the pickups did but I somehow have an opinion on which ones to get! Let me explain: When I was 16, I got my first electric guitar - A Mexico-made Fender Stratocaster. Similar to what I mentioned earlier regarding factory strings, sometimes the pickups are nothing more than tolerable. My guitar's pickups got the job done, but there was often a low hum or buzzing sound coming out of my amp. I eventually replaced them with Fender TexasSpecial pickups. While I didn't know the ins and outs of how pickups worked at that time, I did know that upgrading them would improve my overall tone and reduce the unnecessary humming sound. 


## Amplification

The current generated by the pickups is processed through the guitar's electronics and then is sent to an amplifier. The amp increases the signal's power and sends it to a speaker to produce sound. The amplifier not only allows you to turn up the volume (making sure the neighbors can hear exactly how long it took you to learn "Highway to Hell"), but it also allows you to add effects.

The most commonly used effect is distortion, which can be adjusted from a control knob on the amp itself or via a separate guitar pedal connected to both your guitar and your amp.

Most "combo amps" -- an amp containing both the amplifier and speaker(s) together in a single cabinet -- include built-in controls for adding sound effects. Generally, there is more flexibility and range in a separate guitar pedal, allowing you to highly customize your effect to get the exact tone and crunch level you want.

> :bulb: **My Go-To**:  I've experimented with different brands and setups, and I am happy with my Fender FM 212 DSP combo amp. While I have experimented with Boss and DigiTech brand distortion pedals, I actually prefer my amp's built-in distortion. I can access clean (no effects) and two separate channels of effects via the amp's attached foot pedal.

To summarize the process of producing sound through an amp with an electric guitar:
1. Pluck or strum to apply force to a guitar string, causing it to vibrate.
2. A sound is produced.
     - The frequency of the string's vibration changes the pitch of the sound. Higher frequencies result in higher pitched sounds, and lower frequencies result in lower pitched sounds.
3. As the strings vibrate and produce sound, it affects the magnetic field between the strings and the pickups.
4. The magnetic field changes affect the pickups, triggering them to generate an electrical signal.
5. The electrical signal is processed through the guitar and send to the amp.
6. The amp increases the power of the signal (it amplifies it), and sends it to a speaker, where it is converted back into sound waves that we can hear.

My son is going to get more than he bargained for, as I plan to read this post to him tonight as a bedtime story. Sweet dreams, everyone!
